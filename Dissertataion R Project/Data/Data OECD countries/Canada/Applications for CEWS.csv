Notes:,,,,,,,,
1. Province/Territory is determined by the business address of the applicant  and may not fully reflect where the economic activity took place as some businesses will have employees and/or business activity in more than one jurisdiction.,,,,,,,,
2. 'Missing' indicates that Province/Territory is not available or the business address of the applicant is outside of Canada.,,,,,,,,
3. As employers may submit a separate CEWS claim for each period  the total number of employees for all periods can result in double counting if summing all periods together. As a result  the totals for employee and average per employee are not displayed. The total number of applications does not represent the number of unique employers.,,,,,,,,
4. All counts are rounded to the nearest ten. Approved CEWS amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand. Average amounts are rounded to the nearest dollar. Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole percentage.,,,,,,,,
5. The sum of the data may not add to the total due to rounding.,,,,,,,,
6. Number of employees are as reported on Line A and Line AA of the CEWS application. For periods 5 and subsequent  Line A is the number of eligible active employees. Line AA is only applicable from Period 5 onward and is represented by  “-”  (not applicable) for periods 1 through 4.,,,,,,,,
7. CEWS amounts are as calculated on Line H on the CEWS application.,,,,,,,,
8. Data were produced on January 3  2022. Data are from Canada Revenue Agency source systems as of January 2 2022 11:59:59PM.,,,,,,,,
9. A hyphen [-] indicates that the information has been suppressed for confidentiality purposes. Suppressed information also includes valid zeros.,,,,,,,,
10. Data are subject to change as claims are received  reviewed and adjusted.,,,,,,,,
11. As CEWS claims can be retroactively submitted for any claim period that is open for application data for open periods are not yet complete. While older periods are no longer open for application data for all claim periods are subject to change.,,,,,,,,
12. These data are compiled for CEWS claims that have been approved. CEWS applications currently under assessment or reassessment are excluded pending approval.,,,,,,,,
